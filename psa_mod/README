                        psa - Point Set Analysis

A tool for the analysis of two-dimensional point sets with applications in
graphics.

                                 Overview

psa is a command line tool that takes two-dimensional point sets as input
and analyzes these point sets with respect to several spatial and spectral
statistics important for sampling problems in computer graphics. These 
statistics include:

- Global minimum distance (smallest separation between any two points)
- Average minimum distance (average nearest-neighbor distance)
- Bond-orientational order (similarity to the hexagonal lattice)
- Effective Nyquist frequency (equivalent to Nyq. freq. in uniform sampling)
- Oscillations (metric for potential aliasing caused by the point set)

- Radial power spectrum
- Radial distribution function
- Anisotropy
- Fourier amplitude/power spectrum

For more information regarding these measures, consult our papers:

welcome. Feel free to contact us via http://thomas-schloemer.org.


                               Dependencies

- cairo (http://www.cairographics.org) for PDF and PNG output
- CGAL (http://www.cgal.org) for the bond-orientational order

The CGAL dependency is not strict and can be removed by setting HAVE_CGAL to 0
in the accompanying Makefile. The computation of the bond-orientational order
is then omitted. psa also makes use of OpenMP if available.


                                   Usage

Type

  ./psa filename [options]

to analyze the given file(s). When called without any parameters, psa
generates a single PDF containing all measures. Use --avg if you want to
average all measures over the given files, e.g.

  ./psa --avg points/mypoints*.txt

Type

  ./psa --help

for a list of available options.


                                File Formats

Point set files are supported in three flavors:

- TXT: plain text files with a pair of coordinates for each point
- RPS: raw single-precision floating point data
- EPS: coordinate pairs for each point with a basic EPS header that is
       understood by most EPS viewers

An example for each format is included in /points. Use --convert to convert
files between the three formats. Note that psa cannot read arbitrary EPS
files.

                              Version History
v1.1a
- Fixed some Linux/gcc compile issues

v1.1
- Made oscillations metric independent of effective Nyquist frequency; the metric is now in line with the upcoming ACM TOG paper

v1.0
- psa has been totally rewritten
- Added new statistics: effective Nyquist frequency, oscillations metric, and
  orientational order (the latter needs CGAL)
- Added new 1D measure next to radial power spectrum and anisotropy: radial
  distribution function
- Added option --raw to write the raw data of all 1D measures for better
  post-processing using external tools
- 1D measures are now written as TEX source files based on the TIKZ package
  for cleaner integration into larger documents and potential final touches
- Added options to generate every measure separately
- Added configuration file 'common/psa.cfg' for most important variables
- Can now directly read points from certain EPS files next to TXT and RPS
- Added option --convert to convert points between these formats
- Dropped need for fftw-library
- Dropped computation of star discrepancy

v0.2.2
- Added average mindist measure
- Removed non-toroidal distance measure
- Normalized radius is now called normalized mindist
- Changed default plot colors to black
- Improved code readability

v0.2.1
- Bug fixes with respect to cairo version >1.10.0
- Fixed some MS VS compilation issues

v0.2
- Integrated an optional DFT using the fftw-library
- Non-spectral measurements are now also rendered into summary files
- Added non-toroidal minimum distance computation
- Support for more arbitrarily many point sets in a single directory
- Bug fixes

v0.1
- Initial release
